# Installation

# Usage 

In this dashboard there are two routes first `''` and `'/dashboard'`. This first route goes to the solution of the login page problem statement and second route goes to the solution of the dashboard problem statement

For example if the page is hosted at `localhost:4200`, then the first (login page) solution will be at the address `localhost:4200` and the working dashboard will be at `localhost:4200/dashboard`.
